# LRT-RS: Light-Rail Transit Operation Tracking System

**LRT-RS** is a simulation-based system designed to monitor, track, and manage the operational states of LRT-1 and LRT-2 trains using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** model. The system visually represents train movements and state transitions on a map, providing a structured way to model behavior such as departures, arrivals, delays, and idle states.

## Tools Used
- JavaScript  
- Leaflet.js  
- Finite State Machine (FSM) logic

## Features
- Real-time simulation of LRT-1 and LRT-2 train operations  
- FSM-based modeling of train states and transitions  
- Interactive map visualization using Leaflet.js  
- Functional frontend interface and backend logic for state control

## Purpose
Built to demonstrate how FSMs can be applied to real-world transport systems for efficient state tracking and management.
